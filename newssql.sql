This is as some parents keep mounting pressure on school administrators to give their children double promotion to escape one year school fees.\r\nCross section of members of a book club, Victoria Island, during a review of The Studentsâ€™ Fortress, which was adjudged by Laternabooks Limited as one of the bestsellers in the education department of the bookstores.Vanguard investigations revealed that as parents withdraw their children and wards from private schools, owners of some private schools have introduced attractive discounts to parents to curtail the unfavourable trend.\r\nDiscounted fees\r\nIn one of the schools at Ipaja the offer was; if any parent can pay one year school fees in advance, he or she will get 50 per cent discount the following year.\r\nFor some schools, management has concluded plans to reduce school fees so as to appeal to the conscience of parents who might be thinking ofÂ  patronise public schools.\r\nThe Proprietor of Tob Land Nursery and Primary School, Agege, Lagos, who did not want his name in print lamented that there were some parents who, due to the prevailing economic recession,Â  have gone to owners of private schools seeking for double promotion for their children. Without counting the academic consequence on their wards, some parents have maintained thatÂ  the double promotion will relieve them of the burden of paying school fees for a year.\r\nHis words: â€œAlmost 75% of the parents are unable to pay their childrenâ€™s school fees and buy books due to the recession. Some parents are buying half of the text books.\r\nâ€œThe initial thought was to increase the school fees this term but I was unable to because of the economic challenges. Right now, parents have withdrawn their children to public schools. About 15 students from my school have been taken to public schools.\r\nDouble promotion\r\nâ€˜â€™Some parents are even trying to give their children double promotion and if you do not do that for them, they will take their wards to other schools, just so that they will not pay the school fees of the three terms they are supposed to pay.â€\r\nDr. Shinaayomi Akintolure, Proprietor Stokhan Schools, Iyana Isashi, Lagos said; â€œAs a result of the recession parents are beginning to take the option of withdrawing their children. About 10 to 15 percent are beginning to take their children to government-owned schools, not only because of increase in school fees but because even to keep the home front going has become an issue.\r\nShrink in population\r\nâ€œWe cannot increase our fees. Maybe the highbrow areas can attempt it, but we here cannot.We really have a 10 to 15 percent shrink in the number of pupils, to public schools.â€\r\nAlso, the Principal, Caro Favoured School, Awodi-ora, Lagos, Mr. Mark Okoh said; â€œDue to theÂ  economic recession, there is truly low patronage, if I tell you it did not affect us, it will be a lie. We still have not got the requisite amount of learners returning to school. Even the new ones that are supposed to resume are going to other schools, some public schools, others to more affordable schools.â€™â€™\r\nâ€˜â€™It has always been the system of private schools to tolerate parents who canâ€™t pay the lump sum at once, but this year, parents paying in instalments have increased because of the recession.â€\r\nNon-Profit education\r\nSuggesting a temporary solution,Â  Akintolure said that school owners who really know their onions,Â  need to take their eyes off solely making profit and just focus on educating the children. â€˜â€™This is because you cannot sack teachers like banks sack workers. As proprietors we need to sacrifice about 40 to 50 percent of our profit, if need be, to ensure that children keep getting the best and we remain in business.â€ As Okoh pleaded with the government to look into the recession, turn the economy around so that all aspects of life will return to normal,â€™â€™ he added.\r\nFinancial inability\r\nMrs Gladys Adewumi whose three children attend Living Joy Nursery and Primary School, Ikorodu said she withdrew two of her children from the private school to public schools when it was apparent her husband could not cope financially.\r\nShe said: â€œI operate a beauty salon and my husband is a plumber. For over a year now my husband has not been able to live up to his financial responsibility in the family which led to our over N100, 000 indebtedness to the school.\r\nAusterity measures\r\nâ€œTo reduce the financial burden, we agreed to remove two of our children from the school to a government school at Elepe.The challenge I may encounter now is the distance between our resident and the school which is about five miles,â€ she added.â€\r\nMeanwhile, the Proprietor of Dee-soar Nursery and Primary School, Ikorodu, Mr Samuel Ojo who lamented the devastating effect of the economic recession, noted that since schools resumed from vacation, many students are yet to resume.Â  He said:, â€œHaving had the foresight of the austerity, my staff and I went to parents, encouraged them and tried to instill hope in them. We will still go back to them again, because I know many are planning to go public school.â€\r\nExodus to public schools\r\nThe situation was similar at Wiseman Generation School, Ikorodu. Itâ€™s Proprietress, Mrs Peace Omar, said that many students are yet to resume from vacation, adding that the situation was not unconnected to the recession.Â  She said:â€I know of a parent who withdrew her child to the public school. Because of the hardship, we have decided not to increase school fees, yet parents are not satisfied. The only time we added N2,000, parents complained.â€\r\nOn his part, the proprietor of Gosfat Nursery and Primary School, Agege, Mr. Gosfat said, â€œThe recession has affected every home. Most parents have withdrawn their children and wards and taken them to public schools despite the fact that our school fees is low.\r\nâ€œLast term because of the economy difficulty in the country, I reduced my school fess by N1,000. Yet, most parents still find it difficult to pay.\r\nâ€œThe only reason they are giving me is that there is no money. We have the same market system. What affects the top affects the bottom. This new term alone, I have lost over 20 of my students as a result of the recession which has never happened before.\r\nÂ \r\nThe post Recession: Schools give discounts on fees appeared first on Vanguard News.', '22 Sep 2016, 10:00 am', NULL, 'http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/recession-schools-give-discounts-fees/', '2016-09-22 10:00:00', NULL, 'src="http://d19lga30codh7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/school.jpg"', 'Education', '0'),
(2, 'Scrapping-of-Grade-II-killed-education-in-Nigeria--Akeusola', 'Scrapping of Grade II killed education in Nigeria- Akeusola', 'By Dayo Adesulu\r\nProfessor Olu Akeusola is a Professor of Comparative Grammar and Provost of Michael Otedola College of Primary Education, MOCPED. In this Â interview with Vanguard, he speaks on sundry issues bedevilling the Education sector, positing that ever since priority was placed on certificate, the love for college education declined. Excerpts:\r\nProfessor Olu AkeusolaHowÂ has the work on campus been thus far?\r\nGovernor Akinwunmi Ambode and TETfund have been supportive to the development of the college. About 70% of our completed and on-going projects were sponsored by TETfund.\r\nWhat is the core objective of the school?\r\nItâ€™s a kind of political creation that came as a result of a political somersault in education policy. What happened was that the then military Head of State, Ibrahim Babaginda observed that the quality of education was falling and he wanted to make the Nigerian Certificate in Education the least qualification to teach in Nigerian primary schools.\r\nCollege for primary education\r\nThe moment Babaginda did that, Michael Otedola the then Governor of Lagos State, took advantage of it. The Federal Government made a policy that there should be college of primary education and it shall be the minimum.\r\nThis place was supposed to be made a grade two teacher training college or school of basic studies but Otedola established this college of primary education in 1994 and in 2004, the college was renamed after him. It was formally Lagos State College of Primary Education.\r\nHow relevant isÂ  this college to quality of teachers?\r\nFederal Government that came up with the policy has never had a college of primary education. The Lagos State Government realised that error and arrogance of the military government and corrected it. Education is pyramidal in nature. When you are in primary school, the same 6-3-3-4 system of education is supposed to be interpreted as six years primary education, three years of junior secondary that is technical-oriented, that wasÂ  why they brought those technical machines then.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Then three years of senior secondary that should have been divided into three. It should have been three-year of senior secondary (technical education), three-year secondary, technical education and three-year secondary (general education).\r\nRecreation of NCE: Anybody that finishes three years secondary or technical education could go for four-year polytechnic for a degree or its equivalent. Anybody that studies the three-year grade two or senior secondary then would have gone for NCE or college of education and someone that did three years generaleducation would have gone to the university for four-year degree program.\r\nWe now recreated NCE for primary.Â  When you are still in primary school, you do all subjects and you see the teachers always. When you are in junior secondary school, you do about 16 subjects. When you are in senior secondary school, the subjects reduce to eight or nine. It is at that level you can do a lot of subjects. The moment you go further to national diploma or NCE, it turns to two or three areas of specialization. When you go for your degree, it becomes one major and one minor. We cannot afford to pay specialised teachers as it is done in tertiary institutions.\r\nMethodology\r\nThere is no difference between somebody that did NCE (English-French) in MOCPED and the other person that finished in Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education. The difference only is in methodology.\r\nThe one in AOCOED will be taught methods of teaching adolescents and junior secondary. The one in MOCPED will be taught method of teaching infants/ children. What we have is just a political ingenuity and that is why the Lagos State Govt is saying that instead of having duplication of curriculum, programme and wasteful utilisation of manpower, we should be thinking of allowing one to be running NCE and the other to be a total school.\r\nWhat is your take on those who are not core teachers teaching in schools and how can the situation be remedied?\r\nA lot of people will be talking about falling standard of education and I say, no. During our time, we were doing arithmetic and now, they are doing mathematics. Majority of those things we did in secondary school are being taught in primary school now. But what we enjoyed then that wasÂ  instrumental has been destroyed now. As at that time, there was Grade 3, there was Grade 2 and there was Grade 1.\r\nStandardised teacher education\r\nWe had teachers that were taught. We had teacher education that was well standardised. The little knowledge they had, they had good method of impacting it. It is either you are a teacher or you are a cheat. Majority of people found teaching today are not teachers but cheats. They donâ€™tÂ  see teaching as a profession. They believe that when they get alternative jobs, they will leave. That is the problem we are having in our educational system.\r\nProblems in education\r\nThe Ministry of Health is controlled by medical doctors. The Accountant- General of the federation can never be a teacher. But come to education, if you come to the ministry, the permanent secretary of the ministry is an accountant, the minister can be a politician, I am not against it, but what about his lieutenants, how versatile are they in education? They do not know anything and you cannot deliver what you do not have. That is the problem we have in education.\r\nIgnorant owners: Many private schools are not after educational development. They are after money. Most private school owners know nothing about education. They ask themselves what is the easy way of making money? They invest in education. They do three things. One is to look for cheap labour from usually unqualified people. Two, the quality control is not there because they do not pay the money. It is only when you pay the qualitative money that you get qualitative education. Three, they rely so much on the money they gain from the parents and they have the tendency of aiding their students to pass their WAEC so as to give glory to their college.\r\nMany students during UTME prefer university and polytechnics education to NCE. WhatÂ  do you think led to this?\r\nThere are about five problems to that and we all caused it. We have three levels as regardsÂ  institutions. We have university, polytechnic and college of education. The day we destroyed the Grade 2, was when the problem started. Not until we bring back the Grade 2, we will still not be having feeders for college of education. The feeder that could be feeding NCE in college had been abrogated in 1992. If college is to pick its own product from the same source, automatically, it will be very difficult.\r\nDecline in college education\r\nTwo,Â  ever since priority was placed on certificate, the love for college education declined. The moment you go to college of education for three years, you now go back to university for three years and it is the same qualifications that you will use to enter both college of education and the university. Then what is the essence of wasting two years of your time?Â  People will prefer to go to university and not college.\r\nTeacher scholarships\r\nThree, in the past, in order to produce teachers that will give usÂ  qualitative teaching, they gave scholarships to teachers, they encouraged them by giving them one year salary advance. If weÂ  are not able to do that, we are going nowhere. We cannot eat our cake and have it.\r\nFour, parents discourage their children from teaching. Parents tell their children that teaching is not a very good job.\r\nFive, salary. If the salary for teachers is so poor, who would want to join? That is why we are killing teacher education. All these people that will become doctors and pilots tomorrow, need to be given solid foundation by teachers in the primary, junior and senior secondary before they go and meet the lecturers in tertiary institutions.\r\nOnly adequately trained teachers are supposed to be teaching in primary, junior and senior secondary schools. That is the method of impacting knowledge. If you want to build a house and the foundation is in a shambles, you are going nowhere.\r\nThere has been plan to scrap the 6-3-3-4Â  system and introduce a five-year system. How willÂ  it affect the educational system?\r\nIf it is cancelled and five-year system is introduced, we will move one step forward and three steps backward. What should happen isÂ  one, retain the six-year primary education. Two, three years junior secondary, fortify it and make it technically- oriented. Divide the three years senior secondary into three. Three years secondary (technical) for those who want to go into technical line; three-year secondary for teacher education to replace the old grade two; three-year senior secondary to replace the senior secondary and A level. If you finish from technical college, you go to polytechnic.\r\nTechnical college\r\nThen let Higher National Diploma (HND) be abrogated. Let there be National Diploma as a middle man power. After which you can do your bachelor in technology for two years.\r\nThen it will be four years to do your degree. It will be advisable when you go for technical college for three years; you now do your bachelor in technology for four years. You are not losing anything. Some colleges are offering NCE as well as degree. When you finish a three-year senior secondary teacher education, they will enter into NCE; they will do two years for NCE. If they want to obtain the certificate, they obtain.\r\nThey will now do two years in same school in degree education. Within four years, they will have their degree. If you want to do your years and go, just like ND in technical college, you do your two year andÂ  go. In college, if you want to do your two years NCE, you do it you go, if you want to continue, you do another two years and you have your degree in education.\r\nLet polytechnics and colleges be holding degrees only in their areas of specialization.', '22 Sep 2016, 2:44 am', NULL, 'http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/scrapping-grade-ii-killed-education-nigeria-akeusola/', '2016-09-22 02:44:00', NULL, 'src="http://d19lga30codh7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Prof.jpg"', 'Education', NULL),

The oven and chicken tractor were fabricated using a design first developed at a Kenyan refugee camp. Talk about bringing something good out of&nbsp; a bad situation!\n*The team with Prof. Charles Reith (4th left) , displaying their solar oven and chicken tractorsSolar oven: Living up to its billing as Africa&rsquo;s first development university whose aim is to raise future leaders who will impact their communities and the continent positively, the students did not only learn the theories but applied what they learnt in their Community Development class, to make their community safer, more environment-friendly and better life foe the people.\nWorking under the supervision of AUN&rsquo;s former Director of Sustainability, Professor Charles Reith, Mr Rotimi Ogundijo and Mr. Matthew Abedoh, all of the Sustainability Unit of the university, the students used recycled cardboard, masking tape, glue and aluminium foil to&nbsp;construct the solar ovens. Each oven took them about 45 minutes to construct and it cooks really fast.\nChicken tractors\nThe Chicken tractors were made from scrap metal and pieces of discarded chicken wire (poultry netting). A Chicken tractor is a screened-in box or portable bottomless cage or pen used by organic farmers to prepare soil for planting. The chickens are confined in the tractor and they&nbsp; eat all the weeds, bugs, scratch the soil and fertilize it with their guano or faeces (which is a highly effective fertilizer due to its exceptionally high content of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium essential for plant growth.) This is one of many ways organic growers fertilize their farms without using harmful and expensive chemicals.\nThe students distributed the solar ovens and chicken tractors to villagers in nearby communities as part of their contribution to human development.\nThe post AUN students build solar ovens, chicken tractors appeared first on Vanguard News.', '22 Sep 2016, 2:16 am', NULL, 'http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/aun-students-build-solar-ovens-chicken-tractors/', '2016-09-22 02:16:00', NULL, 'src="http://d19lga30codh7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AUN.jpg"', 'Education', NULL),

(5, 'Rising-above-self-pity', 'Rising above self-pity', 'By Udeme Archibong\r\nWhen you look at the sun, youâ€™ll smell the roses; when you look at the shadows you tread through slimy paths. When you look into the future you get a head-start; when you look at the past, you get into a mould. When you see problems, life remains a droll; when you see solutions, life will be a cruise.\r\nWhen you see tragedy, life will be a nightmare; when you see opportunities, life will be an adventure. When you look within, you discover treasures; when you look without, you discover pressures. When you look up, you will go up; when you look down, you will fall. When you â€œseeâ€ success, you soar, when you â€œseeâ€ failure, you decelerate to the basement of life. Itâ€™s all in what you choose to see or look at. Therefore, what you focus on determines your direction and shapes your experiences through life.\r\nSelf-pity is an agonizing trait that thrives on:\r\nFocusing on what you arenâ€™t\r\nFocusing on what you donâ€™t have.\r\nFocusing on what you canâ€™t do.\r\nSelfâ€“pity has its platform on a negative mental attitude. An individual engulfed in self-pity feels helpless about what they are and where they are. They figure out who and what to blame for the outcome of their lives. They fail to realize that the outcome of their destinies is determined by their choices irrespective of whom and what had caused them pain.\r\nPeople and circumstances do influence us to the extent that we permit it but they canâ€™t determine our destinies. People on the self-pity parade sit in the â€œcornerâ€ of life be-moaning their lot in life and looking for someone to come and get their lives back into shape. They deny responsibility for their lives. Hence, they sink deeper and deeper into the river of low self-worth.\r\nIf there is anyone who had the right to envelope himself in self-pity it was this particular man whose story I share below, but he refused to settle for less than he could be.\r\nHe was a hardworking farmer who struggled to make ends meet. Then on a fateful day the unexpected happened; he was stricken with extensive paralysis and confined to his bed. What a heart wrecking condition he found himself in. His condition was not caused by him; maybe life seemed so unfair.\r\nTo the human mind, he was a hopeless invalid. But this man had an indomitable spirit and became a millionaire despite his circumstance. Letâ€™s consider the steps he took to survive and thrive despite his hopeless condition. First of all, he defined who he was. He reasoned that he was a mind with a body. That established his identity.\r\nSecondly, he chose to be happy, optimistic and to start from where he was. Happiness in life is not dependent on people around you or on your experiences through life; itâ€™s a choice that is exclusively yours. Success starts from where you are. If you wait for all the traffic light to be green before leaving home, youâ€™ll wait till eternity.\r\nThirdly, he chose to count his blessings and not his losses. Yes, he was an invalid but he had a heart full of gratitude despite his predicament.\r\nFourthly, he decided to be valuable rather than become a burden to his family and the society at large. So he engaged his mind in productive thinking. Consequently, an idea was conceived that would transform his life, family and the society. â€œI am no longer able to work with my handsâ€, said he to members of his family, â€œso I have decided to work with my mind. Every one of you can, if you will, take the place of my hands, feet and physical body. Letâ€™s plant every tillable acre of our farm in corn.\r\nThen letâ€™s raise pigs while they are young and tender and convert them in sausages. And then we can package and sell them under a brand name. Weâ€™ll sell them in retail stores all over the country. Theyâ€™ll sell like hot cakesâ€. Indeed, â€˜Jonesâ€™ little pig sausages sold like hot cakes and Milo Jones became a millionaire because he chose to be valuable to others despite his predicament.\r\nWhen we are faced with adversity, we either become problem conscious or solution driven; we can either let adversity get into us or we can let it pass away. Itâ€™s all in the way we choose to respond to the challenges of life. Itâ€™s not what happens to us rather itâ€™s what happens in us that shapes the outcome of our destiny.\r\nYou need to redirect your focus. Focus on what you are; you are the child of the Most High God, made in His image and likeness. Focus on what you have; you have the gift of choice, the gift of time, the gift of relationships, abilities and potentials within you.

I say this because being a lawyer, accountant, doctor, etc brings you in contact with everyday people. If you become a writer, they are the people you will write about. I don&rsquo;t hang around many writers, I find regular people a lot more interesting to talk to.&rdquo;\nOn her inspiration to write, Atta said; &ldquo;It is about history for me. As much as history is taught in schools, I don&rsquo;t think our recent history is taught in schools. Imagine what is taught are the empires, rather than what happened in the early 60s and 70s. What is important for me is to record the time that I remember.\n&ldquo;I am chronicler of my time, it is always about going back in time, recording those things I am scared people might forget. People of my generation became anything but writers, and for me it was terrifying that my entire generation could die out and there would be no one to record what actually happened.\n&ldquo;Hopefully, by reading the book you can go back to those years way before you were born and have some ideas about what it was like to live in Lagos at that time.&rdquo;\nOn dealing with writer&rsquo;s block, the 52 year old writer said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have writer&rsquo;s block when writing fiction. People do, I always feel there must be a reason for it, maybe fear. It has got nothing to do with writing, it goes deeper than that. The only time I suffer from writer&rsquo;s block is when I have to write an essay or when I have to write about myself. I can&rsquo;t write about myself because I don&rsquo;t want to hurt anybody I know. The only way I know how to write is honestly and if I do that, I will hurt someone.&rdquo;\nStating that feminism does not mean hating men, Sefi declared; &ldquo;I am a feminist; it means I am pro women. This doesn&rsquo;t mean I hate men or don&rsquo;t want men to progress, it just means I take a special interest in women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; rights. People often confuse the word with man-hating and that&rsquo;s not really what it is about.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I am pro men as well. I am not a feminist writer because I don&rsquo;t allow any ideology to interfere with my story telling. For instance, even though I do believe in God, I have written about characters that don&rsquo;t. I have written about characters who are sexist, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter; I have to respect them as characters not whatever it is that guides me.&rdquo;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe post Become something in life before you write, Sefi Atta tells students appeared first on Vanguard News.', '15 Sep 2016, 1:04 am', NULL, 'http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/become-something-life-write-sefi-atta-tells-students-2/', '2016-09-15 01:04:00', NULL, '', NULL, NULL),

It was all truly amazing.&rdquo;\nStudents at the summit attended human rights and leadership workshops and they participated in innovation sessions with peers who became close friends by the end of the weekend. The pinnacle of the summit was the innovation sessions that saw small groups of students come together to solve a current human rights issue using the &lsquo;design thinking methodology&rsquo;. They chose from four different case studies that focused on individuals who overcame situations where their human rights were diminished or disregarded. These four individuals&rsquo; stories were featured on the renowned blog &ldquo;Humans of New York&rdquo; and the students were asked to come up with solutions to the issues that the individuals faced in each scenario.&nbsp; Tosin&rsquo;s group worked on finding a solution for women like Bhavani, an Indian woman now living independently in the U.S. after her husband died 15 years ago.

Nigeria, on current trends, will achieve universal primary education in 2070, universal lower secondary education 2080 and universal upper secondary education in the next century.&rsquo;&rsquo;\nIt said that the statistics should urge countries to propel progress towards all global goals outlined in the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, SDGs, adding, &lsquo;&rsquo;education needs a major transformation to fulfill that potential and meet the current challenges facing humanity and the planet.&rdquo;\nThe report on Education for People and Planet, according to UNESCO, shows the need for education systems to step up attention to environmental concerns. While in the majority of countries, education is the best indicator of climate change awareness, half of the countries&rsquo; curricula worldwide do not explicitly mention climate change in their content. Despite being one of the regions most affected by the effects of environmental change, sub-Saharan Africa has far fewer mentions of sustainable development in its curricula in comparison with Latin America, Europe and North America.\n&ldquo;A fundamental change is needed in the way we think about education&rsquo;s role in global development, because it has a catalytic impact on the well-being of individuals and the future of our planet,&rdquo;&nbsp; said UNESCO&rsquo;s Director-General, Irina Bokova.\nShe said: &ldquo;Now, more than ever, education has a responsibility to be in gear with 21st&nbsp; century challenges and aspirations, and foster the right type of values and skills that will lead to sustainable and inclusive growth, and peaceful living together.&rdquo;\nIt further said that education systems must take care to protect minority cultures and their associated languages, which contain vital information about the functioning of ecosystems. But the Report shows 40% of the global population are taught in a language they don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sub-Saharan African houses the most countries with the highest degree of linguistic diversity.\nEducation systems need to ensure they are giving people vital skills and knowledge that can support the transition to greener industries, and find new solutions for environmental problems. This also requires education to continue beyond the school walls, in communities and the workplace throughout adulthood. Yet only 6% of adults in the poorest countries have ever attended literacy programmes.&nbsp; In Nigeria, less than 10% of the poorest rural females can read,\n&ldquo;If we want a greener planet, and sustainable futures for all, we must ask more from our education systems than just a transfer of knowledge. We need our schools and lifelong learning programmes to focus on economic, environmental and social perspectives that help nurture empowered, critical, mindful and competent citizens,&rdquo; said Aaron Benavot, Director of the GEM Report.\nIt said: &lsquo;&rsquo;There is also an urgent need for education systems to impart higher skills aligned with the needs of growing economies, where job skill sets are fast changing, many being automated. On current trends, by 2020, there will be 45 million too few workers with tertiary education relative to demand. Investing in higher education is particularly crucial for growth in sub-Saharan Africa: increasing tertiary attainment by one year on average would increase its long-term GDP level by 16%. Yet, in 2014, only 8% were enrolled in tertiary education in the region, far below the second-lowest regional average, that of South and West Asia (23%), and the global average (34%).&nbsp; In&nbsp; Nigeria, only&nbsp; 6% were enrolled in tertiary education in 2014.\n&lsquo;&rsquo;Inequality in education, interacting with wider disparities, heightens the risk of violence and conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp; Across 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, regions that have very low average education had a 50% chance of experiencing conflict within 21 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Sierra Leone, young people who had no education were nine times as likely to join rebel groups as those with at least secondary education.&nbsp; In Nigeria, inequalities are high: the richest males have over 12 years more education to their name than the poorest females.&nbsp; The Report calls on governments to start taking inequalities seriously, tracking them by collecting information directly from families.\nThe Report emphasizes that the new global development agenda calls for education ministers and other education actors to work in collaboration with other sectors. It lists various benefits that could come from this way of working, including:\n-Educating mothers to lower secondary education in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 could prevent 3.5 million child deaths between 2050-60.\n-Health interventions could be delivered through schools: by one estimation, delivering simple treatments such as micro nutrient pills through schools is one tenth of the cost of doing it through mobile health units.\n-Farmer field schools could help increase crop yields by 12% leading to sustainable increases in food production.\nFour years more in school in Nigeria reduced fertility rates by one birth per young girl.&rsquo;&rsquo;\n&nbsp;\nThe post UNESCO: Nigeria is 70 years late for  2030 SDG education deadline appeared first on Vanguard News.', '8 Sep 2016, 8:06 am', NULL, 'http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/unesco-nigeria-is-70-years-late-for-2030-sdg-education-deadline/', '2016-09-08 08:06:00', NULL, 'src="http://d19lga30codh7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/students6.jpg"', NULL, NULL),

She explained that the curriculum is well loaded academically, morally adding that the challenge is in the quality of its delivery. &lsquo;&rsquo;The standard has been set already, but meeting the set standard by schools is the challenge,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.\nShe maintained: &ldquo;We will achieve this by encouraging an eclectic curriculum that ensures the accommodation of each child&rsquo;s individual learning preferences. Brook House lessons, which will be founded on the nine-year basic education curriculum, will incorporate aspects of the International Primary Curriculum (IPC), the Montessori and High Scope Programme and the Reggio Emilia Approach.&rdquo;\nAccording to her, the school is committed to the highest standards of health, safety and care of the children, adding that its goal of promoting effective teaching practices leading to increased student learning and performance would place it in a unique position to provide an unmatched learning experience for the children.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe post Administrators urged on teachers&rsquo; training for effective delivery appeared first on Vanguard News.', '8 Sep 2016, 2:14 am', NULL, 'http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/administrators-urged-teachers-training-effective-delivery/', '2016-09-08 02:14:00', NULL, '', NULL, NULL),

I say this because being a lawyer, accountant, doctor, etc brings you in contact with everyday people. If you become a writer, they are the people you will write about. I don&rsquo;t hang around many writers, I find regular people a lot more interesting to talk to.&rdquo;\nOn her inspiration to write, Atta said; &ldquo;It is about history for me. As much as history is taught in schools, I don&rsquo;t think our recent history is taught in schools. Imagine what is taught are the empires, rather than what happened in the early 60s and 70s. What is important for me is to record the time that I remember.\n&ldquo;I am chronicler of my time, it is always about going back in time, recording those things I am scared people might forget. People of my generation became anything but writers, and for me it was terrifying that my entire generation could die out and there would be no one to record what actually happened.\n&ldquo;Hopefully, by reading the book you can go back to those years way before you were born and have some ideas about what it was like to live in Lagos at that time.&rdquo;\nOn dealing with writer&rsquo;s block, the 52 year old writer said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have writer&rsquo;s block when writing fiction. People do, I always feel there must be a reason for it, maybe fear. It has got nothing to do with writing, it goes deeper than that. The only time I suffer from writer&rsquo;s block is when I have to write an essay or when I have to write about myself. I can&rsquo;t write about myself because I don&rsquo;t want to hurt anybody I know. The only way I know how to write is honestly and if I do that, I will hurt someone.&rdquo;\nStating that feminism does not mean hating men, Sefi declared; &ldquo;I am a feminist; it means I am pro women. This doesn&rsquo;t mean I hate men or don&rsquo;t want men to progress, it just means I take a special interest in women&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo; rights. People often confuse the word with man-hating and that&rsquo;s not really what it is about.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I am pro men as well. I am not a feminist writer because I don&rsquo;t allow any ideology to interfere with my story telling. For instance, even though I do believe in God, I have written about characters that don&rsquo;t. I have written about characters who are sexist, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter; I have to respect them as characters not whatever it is that guides me.&rdquo;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe post Become something in life before you write, Sefi Atta tells students appeared first on Vanguard News.', '8 Sep 2016, 1:00 am', NULL, 'http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/09/become-something-life-write-sefi-atta-tells-students/', '2016-09-08 01:00:00', NULL, '', NULL, NULL),

After the disappointment of conceding a late leveller to Italy in Turin on Thursday night, Julen Lopetegui''s team took all three points in Albania on Sunday. But it was harder than it should have been.\n&rsquo;Messi only the fifth best striker I&rsquo;ve faced&rsquo;\nAgainst Italy, La Roja had dominated virtually throughout, but they needed an uncharacteristic howler from Gianluigi Buffon to take the lead at the Juventus Stadium and it was a similar story in this one as Spain finally went ahead following an error from Albania goalkeeper Etrit Berisha in the second half.\nPrior to that, they had been in complete control. Lopetegui fielded an innovative 3-3-3-1 system with Gerard Pique, Sergio Ramos and Nacho Monreal at the back, Koke, Sergio Busquets and Thiago Alcantara ahead of them, with Vitolo, Andres Iniesta and David Silva behind lone striker Diego Costa.\n\nIt was Costa who provided the breakthrough, yet had it not been for Berisha''s mistake, the goal may not have arrived. For all their neat play, Spain lacked the ability to create chances for the Brazil-born forward and La Roja are still struggling to break down disciplined defences.\nNothing new about that, but the Costa experiment is bringing only mixed results and doubts remain in the long term over the Chelsea striker''s suitability in Spain''s system. A player who likes to run on to the ball, he fits in better with teams that play on the counter - and that simply is not this side''s style.\nCosta &amp; Nolito strike in Spain win\nNolito came off the bench and scored the second within three minutes of his introduction, linking up well around the box, beating an Albanian defender and slotting in an angled finish. That goal was much more what Spain are about and perhaps the Manchester City forward should start in this team. Nevertheless, it was also questionable defending from an Albanian point of view.\n\n\nIt is early days for Lopetegui and the signs are good&nbsp;at this stage. The performance in Italy was positive and Spain should have won that match, while this was another valuable victory away from home that leaves La Roja on top of Group G with seven points from their three games, with 11 goals scored and only one conceded.\nFirst-ever green card awarded in Italy\n"We are satisfied with the win, the performance and the commitment of the team," Lopetegui said afterwards. "These were two difficult away matches. There is a long way to go in [World Cup] qualifying and we will have to fight match by match."\n\nThat is true. But they will also need to improve because, in the last two tournaments, Vicente del Bosque''s side ultimately failed after a&nbsp;stroll through qualifying. And Lopetegui''s job is to make Spain stronger - be it with or without Diego Costa.\n', '9 Oct 2016, 11:49 pm', NULL, 'http://www.goal.com/en/news/14302/comment/2016/10/09/28324632/costa-and-spain-still-struggling-to-break-down-defences', '2016-10-09 00:00:00', NULL, 'src="http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/GOAL_INTERNATIONAL/2a/f8/albania-spain-graphic_2hpki2i82ytp1ue6b1yro8ckq.png?t=-1421436609"', 'sports', NULL),
